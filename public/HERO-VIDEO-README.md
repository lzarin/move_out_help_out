# Hero background video

To show a moving video behind the first block of the homepage:

1. Get a short video (e.g. people giving/donating boxes, smiling, slow motion) from a free stock site like [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/videos/donation%20boxes/) or [Coverr](https://coverr.co/).
2. Save it as **`hero-bg.mp4`** in this folder (`public/`).
3. The hero will use it automatically: muted, looped, and softened with an overlay so the text stays readable.

If `hero-bg.mp4` is missing, the hero still shows the normal off-white background.
